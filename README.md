# TilesetMaker
A tool that makes designing game tilesets significantly easier. 
It greatly reduces the number of images needed to draw from 47 to 8. These images are automatically rotated and combined to create a full tileset of 47 tiles.
Includes a tile drawing editor and a tileset display with autotiling.
