# TilesetMaker
A tool that makes designing game tilesets significantly easier. <br/>

It greatly reduces the number of images needed to draw from 47 to 8. These images are automatically rotated and combined to create a full tileset of 47 tiles. <br/>

</p>

Includes a tile drawing editor and a tileset display with autotiling. <br/>
